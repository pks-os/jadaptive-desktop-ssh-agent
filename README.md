# Desktop SSH Agent

This application can be used as a GUI direct replacement for ssh-agent on Linux, OSX and Windows. It provides a connection manager to store server profiles and can launch your preferred SSH client on-demand, or alternatively, you can use its own internal Terminal. Connections marked as favorite can be launched directly from the sysytem tray menu.

The agent also allows you to manage your host keys and can be used to store and use private keys on your mobile phone.
